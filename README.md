## What is Bankgirot?

Bankgirot is a Swedish automated clearing house (ACH) for batch processing of high volume domestic low value payments. It facilitates credit and direct debit transfers between Swedish bank accounts. It is commonly used for things like payroll, vendor payments, consumer payments (such as utility bills, insurance premiums, etc.).

## How does Bankgirot work?

Bankgirot uses simple payment files that batches together a group of payments. The payment file is generated by the payment initiator, signed with a digital signature and then uploaded to Bankgirot, typically using SFTP. Bankgirot will then clear the payments described in the file on regular intervals throughout the day. There are multiple ways that the actual transfer of funds can happen. It can for example be a direct transfer between accounts, which is the most common and convenient method. It can also be done by mailing a cheque through ordinary postal service that the reciever can then withdraw the money at a postal office, convenience store or supermarket.
